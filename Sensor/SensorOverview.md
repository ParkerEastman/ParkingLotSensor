#Sensor Overview

The sensor utilized is a photo-transistor.  To test this, a simple circuit consisting of a phototransistor inline with a resistor has been created on a breadboard.  Voltage is passed 
through the circuit, and a multimeter reads the corresponding voltages as varying light intensities are applied to the phototransistor.  The object of this test is to produce an 
appropriate volatage switch based on the presence/absence of a light.  These voltage variations will be passed as analogue voltages to a controller for further action.x
